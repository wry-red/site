Welcome! This is the site of [wry](https://github.com/chrysocolla). I go by the name _chrysocolla_ or _aristolochic_ on the internet. Here I write things about **birdwatching**, **programming**, **learning notes**, **weekly life** and other random stuff I come across.

## Site

The name `Wren` in the site refers to a tini-tiny, brown-feathered, shrimp-catching, fast-jumping, loudly singing, tail-wagging, mice-like bird that usually lives in rock cracks beside water, which I adore.

The site is open sourced on GitHub, so you are welcome to inspect its code or make your own [right here](https://github.com/wry-red/site). If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request at any time.

This theme is written in vanilla TypeScript for SSG and a sprinkling of client-side JavaScript and libraries to add some interactions for a better experience when navigating the site. TailwindCSS is used for styling and Markdown for blog content. While not thoroughly tested, the site works mostly fine with JavaScript disabled.

## Features

Here's how to find things in this site in case you get lost:

- **[Home](/)**: Go to `home` for featured posts and most recently published or updated ones.
- **[Posts](/posts/)**: Go to `posts` for a paginated list of all published posts.
- **[Tags](/tags/)**: Go to `tags` for all available tags. Click on one tag for full published posts tagged with it.
- **[Search](/search/)**: go to `search` for full-text search within this site. You can filter by author and tags in the sidebar.
- Also, click on this moon/sun icon at the top right to toggle between dark/light mode.

Have fun browsing!
