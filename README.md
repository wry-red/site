Welcome! This is the site of [wry](https://wry.red).

The code and design are directly derived from [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev) 👨🏻‍💻's fantastic [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). Project structure like client scripting, full-text search, route generation are heavily modified to suit personal taste.

This theme is written in vanilla TypeScript for SSG and a sprinkling of client-side JavaScript and libraries to add some interactions for a better experience when navigating the site. TailwindCSS is used for styling and Markdown for blog content. While not thoroughly tested, the site works mostly fine with JavaScript disabled.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Running Locally

The easiest way to run this project locally is to run the following command in your desired directory.

```bash
bun create astro --template wry-red/site
```

## 🔑 Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in your site using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=<your-google-site-verification-value>
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
